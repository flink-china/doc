Looking for an issue to work on?
We maintain a list of all known bugs, proposed improvements, and suggested features in Flink’s Jira. Issues that we believe are good tasks for new contributors are tagged with a special “starter” tag. Those tasks are supposed to be rather easy to solve and will help you to become familiar with the project and the contribution process.

Please have a look at the list of starter issues, if you are looking for an issue to work on. You can of course also choose any other issue to work on. Feel free to ask questions about issues that you would be interested in working on.
